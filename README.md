## Description

The El Farol Bar problem is about the probability to go to a bar or not following the crowd. We suppose that the capacity of the bar is a hundred people and that the optimum crowd is 60 people. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, we train an agent to use a good policy to have a maximum reward when going to the bar. 
We also add an extension,
